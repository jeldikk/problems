problem 1:
-----------
	simulate basic IVRS ( interactive voice response system ) to better understand the control flow of code execution.

	to be done:
	------------
	please choose language:
	1.) english
	2.) telugu
	3.) hindi
	4.) tamil

	please choose gender:
	1.) male
	2.) female

	please choose region:
	1.) Coastal region
	2.) Rayalaseema region
	3.) Telangana region

	please chose location:
	1.) location1
	2.) location2
	3.) location3

	according user choses the options provided, finally you need to print the options summary on console like

	output : Hello, You are a male from location1 of Coastal region



problem 2:
-----------
	given integer coefficients of a quadratic equation (a,b,c), find the roots of the quadratic equation.

	hint: use concepts like, given coefficients of a quadratic equation, find the roots of the equation.
				
				use math library to use sqrt function. surf internet on how to include and use mathematical functions


problem 3:
-----------
	Given an integer n call it as index and an integer x call it as base, calculate the value of a polynomial x^n + x^n-1 + x^n-2 + x^n-3 + ... + x^1 + 1.

	hint: write a function taking base and index as argument to calculate powers. Then call this function in the loop.


problem 4:
-----------
	given an integer(N) and a prime number(p), find the highest power of p in N! ( N factorial )

	hint: use concepts from number theory 
				largest power = N/p + N/(p^2) + N/(p^3) + .... 



problem 5:
-----------

	Given the name of a person, reply the person displaying modified form of his name.

	modification to be done: shift each letter of the name by two places 

	example testcase :
	------------------
	input: kamal
	output: mcocn

	input: uvwxyz
	output: wxyzab

	hint: increase the ascii value of each letter to shift the character.


problem 6:
-----------
	write a code for converting spherical co-ordinates( r, theta, phi) to cartesian co-rodinates ( x, y, z)  and also for converting cartesian co-ordinates to spherical co-ordinates

	help: 
		x = r*sin(theta)*cos(phi)
		y = r*sin(theta)*sin(phi)
		z = r*cos(theta)

	similarly given x,y,z. calculate r, theta, phi.



problem 7:
-----------

	Ask user to enter some large integer of length <9 numerals and write code printing the sum of digits of the entered number

	example:

	input: 23456
	output: 20

	input: 340000
	output: 7

	hint: first extract the digits by using division and modulo operator then add those digits


problem 8:
-----------
	write a code to implement a pyramid pattern, ask user to enter number of rows in the pattern
	
	input: 6

	output:
						*
					 ***
          *****
         *******
        *********
       ***********

	hint: observe, the number of stars in nth row are in (2*n + 1) number.


problem 9:
-----------
