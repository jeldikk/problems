problem 1:
-----------
	given an integer(N) and a prime number(p), find the highest power of p in N! ( N factorial )

	hint: use concepts from number theory



problem 2:
-----------
	given integer coefficients of a quadratic equation (a,b,c), find the roots of the quadratic equation.

	hint: use concepts like, given coefficients of a quadratic equation, find the roots of the equation.



problem 3:
-----------

	Given the name of a person, reply the person displaying modified form of his name.

	modification to be done: shift each letter of the name by two places 

	example testcase :
	------------------
	input: kamal
	output: mcocn

	input: uvwxyz
	output: wxyzab

	hint: increase the ascii value of each letter to shift the character.




problem 4:
-----------
	Given an integer n call it as index and an integer x call it as base, calculate the value of a polynomial x^n + x^n-1 + x^n-2 + x^n-3 + ... + x^1 + 1.

	hint: write a function taking base and index as argument to calculate powers. Then call this function in the loop.




problem 5:
-----------
	write a code for converting spherical co-ordinates( r, theta, phi) to cartesian co-rodinates ( x, y, z)  and also for converting cartesian co-ordinates to spherical co-ordinates

	help: 
		x = r*sin(theta)*cos(phi)
		y = r*sin(theta)*sin(phi)
		z = r*cos(theta)

	similarly given x,y,z. calculate r, theta, phi.



problem 6:
-----------
