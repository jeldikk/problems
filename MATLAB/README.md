### Problems

#### Task 1:

Get used to use documentation provided by Matlab. know different commands on how to extract help on specific topic


#### Task 2:

Get your hands dirty with matlab statemetns by trying the constructs that are useful for solving problems.

Here is the cheatsheet that you may try:

``` Matlab
>> linspace
>> ones
>> zeros
>> eye
>> magic
```

#### Task 3:

Get to know how to construct a vector using colon method

**hint:** colon method is a syntactic sugar in matlab for creating vector with start, end and step parameters. This colon method is used in handling for loops.

_basic syntax goes like **start:step:end**_

```Matlab
>> a = 0:1:10 %try this is command line and check values in a
>> b = -90:0.01:90 %try this too
```

_come with some discussion when should I use linspace and when should I use colon method for constructing vectors_



#### Task 4:

Get proper knowledge about arithematic operators ( +, - , / , \*), trignometric function, exponential functions, logarithmic functions available in Matlab.

perform these operations on
1. matrix and scalar
2. matrix and matrix element wise


#### Problem 1:

Define a vector of length N. write a code for finding the sum and mean, variance, standard deviation of values in the vector using loops.

  > hint:
  > surf online for formulaes regarding mean, variance,  standard deviation of a set of values

#### Problem 2:

Define the following vectors for a test case

* _vector of initial velocities the body starts_
* _vector of acceleration the body maintains during journey_
* _vector of time values_

**make sure the length of these vectors are of same length**

with the given information calculate the distance travelled by the body for different intial velocities(u), accelerations(a) and time travels(t)

**hint**: use the concepts from kinematics


#### Problem 3:

Define a signal with sampling rate of 1 kilosamples/second of a given frequency **f**. later introduce some phase shift in the signal, then plot two signals and give some interpretation of the plot when we meet.

**hint**: use concepts from signals and systems.


#### Problem 4:

Learn about spherical co-ordinates and cartesian co-ordinates and its significance. write functions for converting spherical to cartesian and cartesian to spherical co-ordinates.

**information**
_spherical co-ordinates are specified in r, theta, phi._
_cartesina co-ordinates are specified in x, y, z._

**hint**: check online for conversion formulae.

#### Problem 5:
