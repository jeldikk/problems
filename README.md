## Problem Repository

Hi buddy, there may be two reasons you are here at this repository, either you are asked to visit this repository by your mentor or you are referred to come here for sample problems segregated language wise. what may be reason, Your visit to this repository to validate your programming skill-set in a language is justified only when you implement code for all the problems on your own or by making a appreciable effort in learning concepts of solving them.

This is a repository of problems organised language wise for practice. A wide people of different skill levels are kept in mind while designing these problems. So some problems may seem trivial to you and some seem tuff, don't bother, feel free. Different wide variety of contexts ranging from arithematic, control flow, applications are contemplated in designing the problems. So feel like a water in a jar learning the concept and then go for implementation. This repository is a life-time archival, it means new problems keep on adding to the problem statements as time lives on. So feel free to check this repo for new problem updates. 

This repo is an idea of giving freetime-work(hate calling home-work) to students mentored by me when I am off-radar to them. So If you are a person guided by me, you are supposed to solve few given from these problems before logging of from project.
